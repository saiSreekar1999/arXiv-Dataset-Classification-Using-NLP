This project implements key components of MaskRCNN, a sophisticated algorithm designed for instance segmentation. Instance segmentation is a challenging task that merges object detection with semantic segmentation to create a detailed, per-pixel object detection framework.

Part A of the project focuses on the implementation of a Region Proposal Network (RPN), which is crucial for identifying potential object locations.

In Part B, the project progresses to implementing and training the object detection heads. This involves applying classifier and regression losses to refine the detection process, utilizing a pretrained RPN network as the foundation.
